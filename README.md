In this study, exploratory and predictive questions were carried out related to the
5th Sustainable Development goal, which is to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” For our exploratory question, the correlation between mentions of gender equality in public speeches and progress in
gender equality indicators were examined, including the female labor force, unemployment rates,
and parliamentary seats held by women, across a select number of countries from
2000 to 2023. First-world countries show no significant correlation
between the frequency of keywords and indicator progress. However, third world
countries show a moderate correlation.
For the predictive question, a predictive model was developed to forecast the
changes in the gender inequality index based on the gender equality indicators,
sentiment analysis on the speeches, and historical gender inequality index data.
Predictions were made for the Central African Republic, Burundi, and Switzerland
to determine the performance of the model. The metrics showcase that the model
predicts the gender inequality index very well across the board.

An implementation of link prediction is presented using supervised machine learning technique. Various features were selected
that encapsulate the node structure such as common neighbours, degree
centrality and community detection. Models were trained using the
same proportion of positive and negative samples as the solutionsInput
file. Logistic Regression is the model of choice due to its simplicity and
interpretability. It performed very well on our local test data, with an accuracy of 0.89.
